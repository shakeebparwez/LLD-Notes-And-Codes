### Composite Design Pattern

The Composite Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. This pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

### Key Concepts

- **Component**: An interface or abstract class for all objects in the composition, both composite and leaf nodes.
- **Leaf**: A class that represents leaf objects in the composition. A leaf doesn't have any children.
- **Composite**: A class that represents a composite object, which can have children. It implements methods to manage child components.

### When to Use

- When you want to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects.
- When you want clients to be able to ignore the difference between compositions of objects and individual objects.

### Example: File System

Consider a file system where directories can contain files and other directories. Both files and directories implement a common interface.

**Component Interface:**
```java
public interface FileSystemComponent {
    void showDetails();
}
```

**Leaf (File):**
```java
public class File implements FileSystemComponent {
    private String name;

    public File(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    public void showDetails() {
        System.out.println("File: " + name);
    }
}
```

**Composite (Directory):**
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Directory implements FileSystemComponent {
    private String name;
    private List<FileSystemComponent> components = new ArrayList<>();

    public Directory(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void add(FileSystemComponent component) {
        components.add(component);
    }

    public void remove(FileSystemComponent component) {
        components.remove(component);
    }

    public FileSystemComponent getChild(int i) {
        return components.get(i);
    }

    @Override
    public void showDetails() {
        System.out.println("Directory: " + name);
        for (FileSystemComponent component : components) {
            component.showDetails();
        }
    }
}
```

**Client Code:**
```java
public class CompositePatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FileSystemComponent file1 = new File("File1.txt");
        FileSystemComponent file2 = new File("File2.jpg");
        FileSystemComponent file3 = new File("File3.docx");

        Directory directory1 = new Directory("Directory1");
        directory1.add(file1);

        Directory directory2 = new Directory("Directory2");
        directory2.add(file2);
        directory2.add(file3);

        Directory rootDirectory = new Directory("RootDirectory");
        rootDirectory.add(directory1);
        rootDirectory.add(directory2);

        rootDirectory.showDetails();
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **FileSystemComponent (Component)**:
   - An interface that defines the method for showing details. Both files and directories implement this interface.

2. **File (Leaf)**:
   - A class that represents a file. It implements the `FileSystemComponent` interface and provides the actual implementation of the `showDetails` method.

3. **Directory (Composite)**:
   - A class that represents a directory. It implements the `FileSystemComponent` interface and contains a list of child components. It provides methods to add, remove, and get child components, and implements the `showDetails` method to show the details of the directory and its contents.

4. **Client Code**:
   - Demonstrates how to create files and directories, add files to directories, and display the details of the entire file system.

### Advantages:
- **Uniformity**: Treats individual objects and compositions uniformly.
- **Flexibility**: Makes it easier to add new kinds of components.
- **Simplifies Client Code**: Clients can treat composites and individual objects uniformly.

### Disadvantages:
- **Overhead**: Managing the tree structure can add complexity and overhead.
- **Type Safety**: The pattern can make it harder to enforce type safety, especially in languages that don't support generics well.

This example demonstrates how the Composite pattern can be used to represent part-whole hierarchies and allow clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly. Let me know if you have any more questions or need further clarification!
